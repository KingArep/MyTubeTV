## • Attention
I am continuing development of this application, which builds upon the NoTubeTV project (https://github.com/ycngmn/NoTubeTV) after its original developer archived it. Although I am not the original author, I am focused on adding new features and improvements to enhance the app. The NoTubeTV project was inspired by the original TizenTubeCobalt app (https://github.com/reisxd/TizenTubeCobalt).
